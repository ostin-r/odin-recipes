Odin Project - Web Development Foundations Project

I'm going through the basics of web development to fill any gaps in my learning.  Harvard's CS50 gave me a great introduction to computer science, algorithms, and web development, but I need to dive deeper in web development to excel at my job.

This project is a basic web site that contains recipes.
